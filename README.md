ðŸ”¹ Project Title: British Airways Review Analysis Dashboard

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used: Tableau

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
In this project, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze customer reviews of British Airways over a span of several years. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of various aspects of the airline's service, enabling stakeholders to understand customer sentiment and identify areas for improvement.

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights:
Overall Customer Satisfaction: The average overall rating for British Airways is 4.2, indicating a generally positive customer experience.
Service Breakdown:
Cabin Staff Service received a relatively high rating of 3.3, highlighting the commendable performance of the staff.
Entertainment and Food Beverages scored lower, with average ratings of 1.4 and 2.4, respectively, suggesting potential areas for enhancement.
Time-Based Trends: The average overall rating by month shows fluctuations, with notable peaks and troughs. This trend analysis can help identify specific periods with performance issues or improvements.
Geographical Insights: The map visualization displays the average overall ratings by country, helping to pinpoint regions with higher or lower customer satisfaction.
Aircraft Analysis: Different aircraft models received varied ratings. The Boeing 747-400, for instance, had a high average rating of 4.7, while the A321 had a lower rating of 3.8. This analysis aids in understanding customer preferences for different aircraft types.

ðŸ”¹ Filters and Interaction:
The dashboard allows users to filter data based on various metrics such as Overall Rating, Cabin Staff Service, Entertainment, Food, and Ground Service. Users can also refine the data by date, traveller type, seat type, and aircraft group, making the dashboard highly interactive and user-friendly.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion:
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for British Airways to gain insights into customer feedback, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the overall customer experience. The ability to drill down into specific aspects and filter data interactively provides a granular view of customer sentiment, aiding in strategic planning and service improvement.
